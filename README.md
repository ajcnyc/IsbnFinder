Important Notes on Using the MySQL Database
1. Use the IsbnValidator.sql file in the RUN_ME_FIRST_TO_CREATE_DATABASE directory to create the database

2. Credentials (non-root & not used for anything else) are in application.properties, so that you can test with the database 

3. If you want/need to test the application without using the database, I have clearly marked 2 lines to comment out in the IsbnRestController.java file
